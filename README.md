Heyy I was just bored so I wrote these 3 lines. 
If you ever feel worthless in life just feel free to use this tool. 
This tool simply tells you how much energy you have. 
Steps to use Linux/Termux/Mac OS :-  
apt install git python -y && git clone https://github.com/povzayd/energy.git && cd energy && python energy.py


energy.py is just a simple E=Mcc calculator where you can't do much. But the version 2 I.e energyv2.py is much more better supporting different units of mass from picograms to Giga Tons . 
I hope you would enjoy playing with this calculator. ðŸ˜‚. Thanks for reading
